        I'm currently a Software Developer Intern at INVIDI Technologies in Edmonton, Canada, developing and maintaining Kotlin & Python services for seamless ad delivery. 
        Iâ€™m also studying Computer Science at the University of Alberta, where I focus on building scalable, efficient software solutions.
        When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm usually exploring the outdoors, working on side projects, or crossing off something new on my bucket list.
