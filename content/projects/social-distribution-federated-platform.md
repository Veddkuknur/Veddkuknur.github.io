## Project Overview

Social Distribution is a federated social networking platform that enables distributed social interactions across multiple nodes. Built with Django and featuring robust REST APIs, this project demonstrates expertise in distributed systems, API design, and social networking architectures.

## Key Features

### Federated Architecture
- **Multi-Node Communication**: Inter-node communication for distributed social networking
- **Decentralized Design**: No single point of failure
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Supports multiple independent nodes

### RESTful API Design
- **REST APIs**: Well-designed endpoints for social interactions
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization

### Database Design
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust relational database for social data
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized database queries for performance
- **Data Relationships**: Complex social graph modeling

## Technologies Used
