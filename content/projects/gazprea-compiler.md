## Project Overview

Gazprea Compiler is a custom Domain-Specific Language (DSL) compiler built from scratch, demonstrating expertise in compiler design, language parsing, and code generation. The project showcases advanced understanding of compiler internals, optimization techniques, and modern compiler infrastructure.

## Key Features

### Language Design
- **Custom DSL**: Designed and implemented a domain-specific language
- **Syntax Definition**: Defined grammar and language semantics
- **Type System**: Implemented type checking and inference

### Compiler Infrastructure
- **ANTLR Parser**: Used ANTLR for lexing and parsing
- **LLVM Backend**: Code generation using LLVM IR
- **MLIR Integration**: Leveraged MLIR for optimization passes

### Optimizations
- **Matrix Operations**: Optimized matrix operations for performance
- **Code Optimization**: Various compiler optimizations implemented
- **Efficient Code Generation**: Generated efficient target code
