I am a Computer Science student at the University of Alberta and a Software Developer Intern at INVIDI Technologies, where I work on backend services, cloud infrastructure, and frontend dashboards. My work focuses on building scalable systems, optimizing performance, and creating impactful applications that solve real-world problems.

## Current Role: Software Developer Intern at INVIDI Technologies

Since May 2024, I've been working at INVIDI Technologies, where I contribute to ad-targeting pipelines and infrastructure automation. My key achievements include:

- **Backend Development**: Building robust services in Kotlin & Python
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Working with AWS (EC2, IAM, S3, Lambda, Redshift) and Terraform for infrastructure automation
- **Frontend Development**: Creating Vue.js dashboards for internal tools
- **DevOps**: Managing Kubernetes & Docker deployments
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieved 40% latency reduction in ad-targeting pipelines

## Research Experience

As an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the University of Alberta (May 2024 - Dec 2024), I worked on privacy-preserving machine learning, specifically implementing Local Differential Privacy on Graph Neural Networks. This research combines my interests in machine learning, privacy, and distributed systems.

## Teaching Experience

I served as a Teaching Assistant for CMPUT 267 (Basics of Machine Learning) at the University of Alberta (Jan 2024 - Apr 2024), helping students understand fundamental ML concepts and applications.

## Previous Work Experience

**Mobile App Developer at SPL (Single Parent Life)** (Sep 2023 - Dec 2023)
- Developed a cross-platform Flutter app for iOS/Android
- Integrated Firebase and Maps API
- Created a user-friendly interface for single parents to connect and access resources

**Software Developer Intern at TATA Consulting Engineers Limited** (May 2023 - Aug 2023)
- Built ML models (ARIMA/SARIMA) for inventory forecasting
- Migrated legacy systems to React.js
- Created technical documentation including ER/UML diagrams, FRS/FDS

## Notable Projects

**MediCheck** — AI healthcare platform that won 3rd place at HackED hackathon
- Voice-enabled chatbot using Whisper, DeepSeek, and Llama 3.2
- RAG pipeline with AstraDB
- Built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Python

**Gazprea Compiler** — Custom DSL compiler
- Implemented in C++ using LLVM and MLIR
- ANTLR for parsing
- Optimized matrix operations

**Social Distribution** — Federated social networking platform
- Django backend with REST APIs
- PostgreSQL database
- Inter-node communication for distributed social networking

**QR-GO Mobile Game** — Android QR code collection game
- Java development with Google Maps SDK
- Firebase integration
- Achieved 60% crash reduction through threading and async improvements

**Custom GAN Image Generator** — PyTorch GAN implementation from scratch

**Custom YOLOv5 Object Detector** — Computer vision project for object detection

**Carbon Footprint Calculator** — Android app in Java for tracking environmental impact

## Technical Foundation

I have strong experience across the full stack, from mobile development with Flutter and Android to web development with React, Vue.js, and Next.js. My backend expertise spans Python, Kotlin, Java, and Node.js, with experience building REST APIs and working with various databases including PostgreSQL, Firebase, and AstraDB.

## Cloud & DevOps

I'm proficient with AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda, Redshift, IAM), Kubernetes, Docker, and Terraform. I've used these tools to build scalable, maintainable infrastructure and automate deployment pipelines.

## Machine Learning & AI

My ML experience includes PyTorch, GANs, YOLOv5, Graph Neural Networks, and Local Differential Privacy. I enjoy working on projects that combine machine learning with practical applications.

## What Sets Me Apart

What distinguishes my work is the ability to work across different domains—from mobile apps to web platforms, from research to production systems. I enjoy solving challenging problems and building tools that have real impact. Whether it's optimizing ad-targeting pipelines, building privacy-preserving ML systems, or creating hackathon-winning applications, I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and delivering results.

## Looking Forward

I'm passionate about building scalable systems, working on impactful projects, and continuing to learn and grow as a developer. My interests include privacy-preserving ML, full-stack development, and creating applications that make a difference. I'm always working on side projects and enjoy outdoor activities when I'm not coding.
